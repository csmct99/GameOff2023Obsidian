## Submission
Once submitted, your entries will be evaluated by fellow participants, and you'll also have the chance to play and cast your votes on their games too.  

Voting will open shortly after the jam ends and is open to everyone who’s submitted a game.  Entries will be rated on the following categories: Overall, Gameplay, Graphics, Audio, Innovation and Theme Interpretation. Voting will end on January 8th, 2024 at 13:37 PT.

As always, we'll highlight some of our favourites games on the GitHub Blog, and the world will get to enjoy (and maybe even contribute to or learn from) your creations.
