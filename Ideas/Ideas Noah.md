Name: Powerscale
Superhero/villain mangement game where you hire lame heroes with basic abilities and pit them off against other heroes/villans. Improving and giving them powers over time.
	Inspired by Deathbattle youtube videos, The Boys, Punch Club 1 & 2

Gameplay: You manage your own Hero/Villain Organization and make money off of fights that your heroes win. Use those earnings to improve your facility and powers for your heroes.

Characters would have stats such as Health, Stamina, Dodge, Attack, Speed?

Challenges we might run into:
	AI battles, Animations, most of the shit we aren't well versed in ofc.
	We might be able to deal with most artistic problems by having the artstyle look like Realm of the Mad God or something.

Random ideas:
Animal with scales that you swap out for different abilities?

Any mech game has scale, but we would have to work in a 3D enviroment.

Something like vampire survivors? Amount of enemies increasing in scale.

An arena stick fight-like game where you try to blow up players that are balloons? Using air like weapons to explode them? Like the game Morphies Law. But 2D. ![[Pasted image 20231102142622.png]]![[Pasted image 20231102142038.png]]

A pirate scavenger space game where you start with a skeleton ship, and raid other space ships. After winning you use the parts to increase the size of your ship. To the style of heat signature, but mechanics like terratech.
