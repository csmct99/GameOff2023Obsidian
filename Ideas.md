Name: Powerscale
Superhero/villain mangement game where you hire lame heroes with basic abilities and pit them off against other heroes/villans. Improving and giving them powers over time.
	Inspired by Deathbattle youtube videos, The Boys, Punch Club 1 & 2

Gameplay: You manage your own Hero/Villain Organization and make money off of fights that your heroes win. Use those earnings to improve your facility and powers for your heroes.

Characters would have stats such as Health, Stamina, Dodge, Attack, Speed?

Challenges we might run into:
	AI battles, Animations, most of the shit we aren't well versed in ofc.
	We might be able to deal with most artistic problems by having the artstyle look like Realm of the Mad God or something.
