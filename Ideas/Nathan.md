Mini games start with a negative debuff, and progression through it mitigates it. success results in permanent or temp buffs

fun part: balance between 3 things, all result in money
workers - directly make money, but lose money if not enough customers
customers - generate influence, but only if theres enough workers to meet demand
real estate - limits number of workers, end game stuff (you buy up to a country/continent and then prestige to the next area, buy the world = win)


start with friends/family, they leave slowly over time as you make choices, but starts the income off the ground.
