Mini games start with a negative debuff, and progression through it mitigates it. success results in permanent or temp buffs

fun part: balance between 3 things, all result in money
workers - directly make money, but lose money if not enough customers
customers - generate influence, but only if theres enough workers to meet demand
real estate - limits number of workers, end game stuff (you buy up to a country/continent and then prestige to the next area, buy the world = win)


start with friends/family, they leave slowly over time as you make choices, but starts the income off the ground.



# MONEY

Costs some amount of money

1. friends/family = FIXED (slowly leaves)  0.5?$ / interval
2. Worker = $1 / interval

4. Engineer = 1 x Salesman / interval
5. Manager = 1 x Engineer / interval
6. President = 1 x Manager / interval

Generating Money
HR Cap = 10

# Real-estate

1. Building = 1 x HR
2. Complex = 10 x HR
3. Highrise = 50 x HR
4. Town = 1000 x HR
5. City = 10000 x HR
6. District ...
7. Territory/State
8. Country
9. Continent
... prestige x5 ...
10. World


# Influence (Customer Base)

- Same as Money progression
- Use money to buy them
- Acts like a multiplier for income
- Maybe you need a balance on your influence (customers) vs your workers.
- MAYBE: Top end is president, need it before you buy a country


Currency: Influence
Costs money to buy.

1. Customer = 1 Influence / Interval
2. billboard = 1 Customer / Interval
4. Youtuber = 1 billboard / Interval
5. Twitch Streamer= 1 Youtuber / Interval
7. Only Fans = 1 Only / Interval
9. Media comp =  1 Media comp / Interval

# Perks

Spend influence to buy perks

Perks:

- More efficient workers
- More efficient ads 
- More space in buildings


# Decisions

Periodically player will be presented with decisions of varying helpfulness that will ask them to make a choice between multiple options. These choices may be benificial or detremental

Decisions have a hidden "get fucked" rating, representing their 'no win'-ness. the more money you have the more likely to get higher "get fucked" value decisions to illustrate the loneliness of wealth.

Examples:

- Give your workers christmas off? (YES: - Income for the day (some time) NO: - Gain a small buff to income or something)
	- Player is not incentivized to pick the nice option but just their own morals
		- At the end of the game the rich get fucked anyway
