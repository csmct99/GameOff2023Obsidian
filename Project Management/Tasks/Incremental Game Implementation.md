# Description

This should be the foundation for what will become the Money tree.
But since we have several similar incremental systems (Realestate and Influence) it should be extendable to those as well

So maybe 4 classes,
1 master
3 inherit or composed from master interface wtvr u wanna do

# Notes



# TODO

- [ ] Backend structure for making the incremental games is complete
- [ ] Example (money tree maybe) works and is playable
