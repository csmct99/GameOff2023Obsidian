# SFX

What we need:
- Looping background tracks
	- UI game
	- Office themed? 
	- Corperate theme?

- Payoff SFX for buying shit, 
	- 99% of the game is buying shit
	- Make it addicting happy ding noise.
	- Research dopamine firing buttons

# Mechanics

Incremental
- Ethics?
	- Bioshock little girls
	- Kid in hospital needs drugs, :(
- Money printers are workers

Simple Incremental Example:
- Workers (+1 moneis /s)
- Team Lead (+1 workers/s)
- Managers (+1 team lead/s)
- Executives (+1 )
- Companies 
- Monopolies
- Brands

### Mini Games
- Spec into different mini games
- Get stock market mini game
- Gambling mini games
- Black market game
- Warmonger
- Proxy Wars ;)
- Pong
	- Getting hit on either side escalates the firing 

### Decision Cards

Frost punk-esque decision cards
- Scaled for good and bad
- Later in the game when we are fucking with the player, decisions can be made to be either bad or worse. 


##### EXAMPLES
- Recession
	- Fire workers
	- pay cut
- Christmas
	- Work hard
	- day off
